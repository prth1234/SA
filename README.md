# Sentiment Analysis - Exploring Emotions in Unfamiliar Languages

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis project! The goal of this project is to delve into the world of sentiment analysis for languages that might be unfamiliar. Through this exploration, we aim to understand and analyze the emotional tone conveyed in texts without prior knowledge of the language.

## üöÄ Features

- **Language-Agnostic Sentiment Analysis:** Employ machine learning techniques to analyze sentiments irrespective of language understanding.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Leverage pre-trained models for sentiment analysis that can handle multiple languages.
- **Text Input Support:** Accept text inputs in various languages for analysis.
- **API Endpoints:** Expose API endpoints for users to submit text for sentiment analysis programmatically.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core language for implementing sentiment analysis.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries:** Utilize libraries like NLTK or SpaCy for text processing.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Explore models like VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for sentiment analysis.
- **API Development:** Utilize frameworks like Flask or Django for creating API endpoints.
